# AUTOBLADE:INTELLIGENT LAWN MOWING SYSTEM
Taking the hardware developed as part of clement thomas work on AUTOBLADE and adapting it to fit a 2019 Landroid 

This is my first venture into Github so it might get a bit clunky. 
Usual rules apply.. please try to be constructive, I'm learning as I go so if you're going to leave some negative feedback have the grace to tell me why and how I can put it ri
however, the Landroid does have cut to edge capability that the Open mower doesnt have and when all is said and done it probably works out at about the same cost.

According to the Gurus on Discord, the firmware in the Landroid is encoded, the data streams between the processors is encoded, the main processor is read locked and the JTAG interface is disabled.
I dont have the knowledge, expertise or equipment to hack into the exiitng Landroid hardware so the plan is to make best use of the Openmower hardware and firmware thats already been developed 
and port it into the Landroid WR141E.

The main thrust of this first stage of the project is to adjust the Openmower motherboard to fit into the available space in the Landroid.
